# Lead Scoring Classification ðŸ§ 

This project is part of the **Machine Learning Zoomcamp** by [DataTalks.Club](https://datatalks.club/).  
The goal is to build a **logistic regression model** that predicts whether a potential client (lead) will convert based on engagement and demographic features.

## Key Highlights
- ðŸ§¹ Data cleaning and preprocessing  
- ðŸ”¢ One-hot encoding of categorical variables  
- ðŸ¤– Logistic regression model training and evaluation  
- ðŸ“ˆ Feature correlation and insights visualization  

## Files
- `Lead_Scoring_Analysis.ipynb` â€” main notebook with data exploration, feature engineering, and model training

## Results
The model achieved solid classification performance, demonstrating how structured feature preparation can improve predictive accuracy in lead scoring tasks.
